In the fast-paced world of cybersecurity, staying updated on the latest vulnerabilities is paramount. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) offers a REST API that simplifies this task. Let's explore how you can harness this API to access the most recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

**Accessing the NVD REST API:**
The NVD REST API endpoint, available at 'https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0', is your entry point to CVE data.

**Customized Searches:**
The full list API documentation can fetch from here https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities. Tailor your search by employing parameters like `pubStartDate` and `pubEndDate` to filter CVEs based on date.

**Integration and Automation:**
Integrate the NVD API into your security tools to automate CVE monitoring, ensuring you're promptly alerted to potential threats.

The below widget will list all the CVEs which are from between the dates.
